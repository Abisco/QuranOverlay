# The Quran Overlay Project
The Quran Overlay project is a web platform for providing Quran Verses in a lower-third or full screen format quickly. This is used mostly for overlaying purposes, but can also be used for searching for verses quickly.

Here's an example of its usage at the Jaffari Community Centre in Toronto: https://youtu.be/y6iurRnLY5Y?t=23m22s

## Usage
There are a few different ways to utilize the platform: 

### Navigation
The left and right arrow keys (and space bar) can be used to navigate the verses quickly. At the end of every Surah, verse 0 will be opened (Bismillah - except for Surah 1 and 9) upon navigating to the next verse. 

### Quick Verse Lookup
To quickly look up a verse, you can type the Surah number anywhere on the screen, followed by a colon or semi colon, then the verse, followed by the enter button. It is good practice to start with the backspace button to clear the current search (in case of accidental keys pressed). 

Example: 36:1 typed in would bring up Surah Ya Seen verse 1. 

### Search Bar
The search bar provides easy access to the various verses in the database. A maximum of 20 verses is shown at a time, ordered by Surah number, then Verse number. You can search by English or Arabic, with verses and surah names both being searched at the same time. Clicking on a verse will select that verse to present. 

### Settings
The settings area in the top right corner can be opened and closed by clicking on it. This gives accessiblity to change the layout of the page (lower third or full screen), as well as changing the background colours, font colours, and font sizes universally. It is also possible to individually deselect the different elements or change their properties and styles. 

## Hot Keys
* Backspace: Delete current quick verse lookup
* Left Arrow: Display previous verse
* Right Arrow or Spacebar: Display next verse
* ?: Toggle the navbar
* Colon or Semi colon: Following entering a Surah number, the colon or semi colon key will switch the search to a verse look up
